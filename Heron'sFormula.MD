The code below shows you how to create a program that finds the area of a triangle just by knowing the sides you input:
* Disp "INPUT A" (This asks the user to input the length of side A)
* Input A (This inputs the length of side A)
* Disp "INPUT B" (This aks the user to input the length of side B)
* Input B (This inputs the length of side B)
* Disp "INPUT C" (This asks the user to input the length of side C)
* Input C (This inputs the length of side C)
* (A+B+C)/2->S (This finds the value of S by dividing the perimeter by 2; the arrow stores this value as S)
* âˆš(S(S-A)(S-B)(S-C))->D (This performs Heron's formula and stores the answer as D)
* Disp "AREA IS:" (This displays the AREA IS:)
* Disp D (This displays D which contains the area of the triangle)
