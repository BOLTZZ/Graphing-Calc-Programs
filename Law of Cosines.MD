This program runs the law of cosines to find the value of c (a side). Law of cosines: c = √(b^2 + a^2 - 2abcos(θ)).

* Disp "Input B" (Asks the user to input for B)
* Input B (Stores the input for B)
* Disp "Input A" (Asks the user to input for A)
* Input A (Stores the input for A)
* Disp "Input θ" (Asks the user to input for θ)
* Input θ (Stores the input for θ)
* √(B^2 + A^2 - 2abcos(θ)) -> C (Performs the law of cosines for C; stores the value of C)
* Disp "C:" (Displays C:)
* Disp C (Displays the value of C)
